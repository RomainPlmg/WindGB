WindGB is a **GameBoy** emulator written in C++. I wrote it to be as most cycle accurate as possible.
This project is a personal playground to explore emulators. It is not production-ready, but reflects my interest in low-level development and video games.
To run it, type the following command:
```bash
./windgb <path-of-rom>
```
